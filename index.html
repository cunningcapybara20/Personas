      <h1>Personas and Storyboarding Project</h1>
      <h2>Interface</h2>
      <p>The interface that I chose was an Aroma brand rice cooker that I have
        in my apartment.
      </p>
      <h2>Description of Interface</h2>
      <div class="rice cooker sketch">
        <img class="rice cooker" src=personas_pics\interface_sketch.jpg style="width:400px; height:400px">
      </div>
      <p>
        Here is a sketch of the rice cooker in question (a fairly standard rice 
        cooker). One of the main problems with the interface is that it does not
        give the user substantial feedback to each of the button presses. For 
        example, the light will turn red for "cooking," but does not give a timer
        until there are 10 minutes left. Only a rotating red light until then. 
        The key components are the front set of buttons and the container for the 
        rice. The buttons that are contained on the front of the interface have 
        a button for white rice, brown rice namely. But, also include buttons for 
        settings like steam (for vegetables), slow cook, flash rice, delay timer, 
        and keep warm. While the main function is for rice, it does have these 
        other functions as well: for other foods like meat and vegetables. During
        use, the timer screen shows are red line rotating around the outer edge
        of the box and then displays a timer counting down from 10 once there are 
        ten minutes remaining. This is different for the steam and slow cook 
        options, as the user decides the time that it will be cooking for.

      <h2>Observations and Interview From Users</h2>
      <h3>Questions: </h3>
      <p>1. Which function of the product did you use and why?<br>
        2. Have you used the product or another function of the product before?
        If so, which ones?<br>
        3. Was there anything that made the product difficult to use? <br>
        4. What would you improve about the product?<br>
        5. How would you describe your overall experience using the product?<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Answers</h3>
      <ul><li>
          Users each used a different function on the rice cooker and had
          separate motivations. The first is a daily user of the machine and used 
          it (and still uses it almost exclusively) for the white rice function in
          order to meal prep for the week. The second used the brown rice function
          while she was trying to make quinoa for dinner. The third used the steam 
          function while trying to make some vegetables for her dinner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users were of varying experience levels, both with the machine itself 
          and some of the functions within the machine. The first user had 
          significant experience with the white rice function, but was lacking 
          in experience with the other functions. The second user had experience 
          with each of the functions, but not much with any of them. The third 
          user had no prior experience with the machine and was using it for the 
          first time. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Users each had complaints about different aspects of the machine that
          had offered difficulties to them in the experience. The first user 
          admitted that the learning curve to the machine could be more steep 
          without proper instruction or prior knowledge, but he was fully 
          comfortable with it now. The second user felt that the machine did not
          give adequate feedback to the user about when the cooking would be 
          complete, feeling that it was difficult to plan around the rest of her
          meal's ingredients without knowing a more concrete time. The third user
          felt that the machine's functions outside of rice were not as intuitive
          as they could have or should have been for a new user like herself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users found that the same improvement could be made to the product for 
          each of their issues, a more detailed timer functionality. The first user
          while not overly upset about the timer, mentioned it would be nice to 
          have a longer countdown. Meanwhile, the second user was adamant that a 
          timer that gave the full countdown is necessary for her busy schedule.
          The final user felt that the machine was difficult to use because the 
          timer did not give a complete picture to how the cooking process worked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users had varying overall experiences ranging from stressful to very 
          easy. The first user was very familiar with the interface and had a 
          "typical easy experience." The second user had a end outcome that was
          positive, she was able to make her quinoa. But, mentioned that it was 
          more of a leap of faith than she would have liked. The third user had 
          the most difficult time with the machine and said that it was more 
          stressful because she didn't know what she was doing, and the machine
          is meant to be easy to use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Observations:</h3>
      <p>Two of the users had issues surrounding the ratio of rice to water in 
        the machine, because there was nothing on the machine that helped to 
        explain. This lead to two different attempts of ratios that had varying 
        successes. One used a 1:1 ratio and it worked fine; it was their typical 
        ratio that has worked over time. The second was 1:1.5 and it lead to a 
        overcooked cup of quinoa. The third user ended up with successful 
        steamed vegetables, but was stressed and unsure of how to do so before 
        trusting that the machine would be able to make it work. All three users 
        commented on the assumed knowledge about how the machine works by the 
        machine itself during their usage. With remarks like "how would I ever 
        figure that out," or "I guess I will give this a shot." The buttons are 
        meant to give a simpler use case for the general user, but ended up 
        offering more problems than solutions to the three users I observed.

          Dylan is a upperclassmen undergraduate student at a local state 
          university that has committed himself to the gym, keeping healthy, and 
          meal prepping. He found out about a rice cooker and it has massively
          decreased the time it takes him to meal prep his white rice on sundays.
          He doesn't really use it for anything else, but it serves the main purpose
          he uses it for very well. He tried to branch out to slow cook the chicken 
          in his meal prep this week and realized he had no idea how to. He had 
          difficulty figuring out how to from online tutorials because it wasn't 
          the same brand machine.

          Alison and her family of four are trying to branch out as the kids get 
          olders and are trying new recipes. She recently got a rice cooker 
          because her family wants to try more recipes with rice in them. She 
          ran into trouble with the new rice cooker she got because she knew 
          nothing about water to rice ratios, how long it takes to cook or what 
          type of rice is best to cook in the machine. Now, her chicken, broccoli 
          and sesame seeds are ready, but she needs to wait an unknown amount of 
          time for the rice to be done cooking. Her family is busy and now the 
          kids have to wait until after soccer practice to eat and are upset about
          the prospect of trying new foods going forward.
